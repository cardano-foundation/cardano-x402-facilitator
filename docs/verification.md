# Verification Rules

What `POST /verify` actually checks, in the order it checks it. Settlement runs
the same pipeline before it submits anything, so everything here applies to
`/settle` too.

Implementation: `service/verification/ExactCardanoScheme.java`, plus one verifier
per `assetTransferMethod` under `service/verification/method/`.

## Design constraints worth knowing

- **The facilitator never signs.** It receives an already-signed transaction and
  decides whether to accept it. There is no key material in this service.
- **Checks are ordered cheapest-first.** Envelope and decode are pure CPU; chain
  I/O only happens once the payload is structurally credible. A malformed
  payload never costs a Blockfrost call.
- **Every rejection is a `200 OK` with `isValid: false`.** See [api.md](api.md).

## Pipeline overview

| Stage | Does | Chain I/O |
|---|---|---|
| A | Envelope: version, scheme, network, payload shape, requirement sanity | no |
| B | Decode CBOR, network id, signatures | no |
| C | Validity window and protocol limits | yes |
| D | Replay protection and payer authorization | yes |
| E | Value transfer + per-method dispatch | yes (protocol params) |

---

## Stage A — envelope

No I/O. Ordered:

1. `paymentPayload.x402Version != 2` → `..._unsupported_version`
2. `accepted` missing, or `accepted.scheme`/`paymentRequirements.scheme` ≠ `"exact"` → `unsupported_scheme`
3. `normalize(accepted.network)` ≠ `normalize(requirements.network)` → `network_mismatch`
4. `requirements.network` not a supported Cardano network → `network_mismatch`
5. `payload.transaction` or `payload.nonce` missing/empty → `invalid_exact_cardano_payload`
6. `nonce` not matching `^[0-9a-fA-F]{64}#\d+$` → `..._nonce_invalid`
7. **A4** base64 length implies more than `x402.verification.max-tx-bytes` decoded → `invalid_exact_cardano_payload`

   Estimated from the base64 length (`len * 3 / 4`) *before* decoding, so an
   oversized body is rejected without allocating it.
8. **A5** requirement sanity — all → `invalid_exact_cardano_payload`:
   - `amount` not an integer string (`"amount is not an integer string"`)
   - `amount` ≤ 0 (`"amount must be positive"`)
   - `asset` neither `lovelace` nor `^[0-9a-fA-F]{56}\.[0-9a-fA-F]{0,64}$` with an
     even-length name part
   - `payTo` not a Shelley address whose bech32 prefix matches the network
     (`addr` on mainnet, `addr_test` otherwise)

A5 exists because the requirements come from the *resource server*, not the
payer. A typo'd `payTo` or a negative `amount` would otherwise fail deep in the
pipeline with a misleading payer-blaming error.

## Stage B — decode

9. CBOR won't decode → `..._transaction_decode_failed`
10. Tx network id present and ≠ the expected id (mainnet 1, testnets 0) → `..._network_id_mismatch`
11. No vkey witnesses **and** no script witnesses → `..._unsigned`
12. Signature check fails → `..._invalid_signature`

## Stage C — time and protocol limits

13. If the tx carries a validity interval, fetch the current slot:
    - lookup fails → `exact_cardano_facilitator_chain_lookup_failed`
    - `ttlSlot <= currentSlot` → `..._ttl_expired`
    - `validityStartSlot > currentSlot` → `..._not_yet_valid`
14. Protocol params fetch fails → `exact_cardano_facilitator_chain_lookup_failed`
15. **C3** serialized size > `min(max-tx-bytes, protocol maxTxSize)` → `invalid_exact_cardano_payload`

    A4 bounds work before decoding; C3 re-checks the true size against the
    *live protocol limit*, so a tx that could never be accepted by a node is
    rejected here rather than at submission.

## Stage D — replay protection

This is the part that stops a payment being spent twice, so it's worth reading
closely.

16. `nonce` is not among the tx's inputs → `..._nonce_not_in_inputs`
17. Any UTxO lookup throws → `exact_cardano_facilitator_chain_lookup_failed`
18. Any input resolves to `Unknown` → `exact_cardano_facilitator_chain_lookup_failed`
    (`"input state unknown (indexer sync horizon)"`)
19. The nonce UTxO is not `Unspent` → `..._nonce_not_on_chain`
20. Any other input is `Spent` → `..._input_not_available`
21. **D5** payer is not authorized → `..._payer_not_witness` *(additive code)*

**UTxO state is tri-state — `Unspent`, `Spent`, `Unknown` — and the third one
carries the safety property.** An indexer that hasn't caught up cannot
distinguish "never existed" from "not indexed yet". Collapsing `Unknown` into
either answer is a real bug in both directions: into `Spent` and you reject
honest payments; into `Unspent` and you accept replays. So `Unknown` is neither
— it's a retryable `chain_lookup_failed`. **An error is never absence.**

**D5** (`checkPayerAuthorization`) closes an authorization gap: without it, an
attacker could name someone else as the payer. It rejects when the payer address
is unparseable or Byron, has an empty payment credential, is a key credential
absent from the verified witness key hashes, or is a script credential with no
script witness.

## Stage E — value transfer and method dispatch

Iterates the outputs and takes the first that fully covers the amount. For that
output:

- Below the min-UTxO floor (`MinAdaCalculator`) → `..._min_utxo_insufficient`
- Dispatch to the method verifier (below); its error is returned verbatim
- Otherwise → `isValid: true` with the resolved payer

If no output matched, the failure is attributed by how far it got:

| Condition | Code |
|---|---|
| No output pays `payTo` | `..._recipient_mismatch` |
| Output exists but wrong asset | `..._asset_mismatch` |
| Right recipient and asset, too little | `..._amount_insufficient` |

Unexpected exceptions become `..._verification_error`; `ChainLookupException`
becomes `exact_cardano_facilitator_chain_lookup_failed`.

## Choosing an `assetTransferMethod`

```java
requirements.extra.assetTransferMethod   // "default" | "masumi" | "script"
```

Absent `extra`, or absent key → `"default"`. Unknown value → `unsupported_scheme`
(`"assetTransferMethod '<x>' is not supported by this facilitator"`).

**Read from `paymentRequirements.extra`, never `paymentPayload.accepted.extra`.**
The payload half is payer-supplied; letting it pick the method would let a payer
downgrade `masumi` escrow rules to `default`. The canonical requirements are the
only trustworthy source.

The verifier runs **only** for the output that already passed
address + asset + amount + min-UTxO. Method rules are additive on top of the
shared checks, never a replacement.

---

## `default`

No additional checks — address-to-address is fully covered by Stage E.

## `masumi` — `vested_pay` escrow

Verifies that funds are locked into the Masumi escrow contract correctly, rather
than merely sent to its address. Rules M1–M9, in order:

| # | Check | Code |
|---|---|---|
| M1 | `extra.contractAddress` present and ≡ `payTo` | `..._masumi_contract_mismatch` |
| M1b | `payTo`'s script hash is in the configured allowlist (if set) | `..._masumi_contract_mismatch` |
| M2 | An output to `payTo` carries an inline datum | `..._masumi_datum_missing` |
| — | That output carries **no** reference script | `..._masumi_reference_script` |
| — | Datum parses as a lock datum | `..._masumi_datum_invalid` |
| M3 | Structural invariants (below) | `..._masumi_datum_invalid` |
| M8 | Deadline (below) | `..._masumi_deadline` |
| M9 | Collateral bounds (below) | `..._masumi_collateral` |
| — | Exact asset set (below) | `..._masumi_asset` |
| M9 | Post-result min-UTxO | `..._masumi_min_utxo` |
| M7 | Declared `extra` fields match the datum | `..._masumi_datum_mismatch` |

**M3 structural invariants** — all must hold, else the datum is not a fresh lock:
state is `FundsLocked`; `resultHash` empty; both cooldown times zero; neither
buyer nor seller credential is a script; `referenceSignature` at least 16 bytes
(32 hex characters — the field is hex-encoded, so the check is on string length);
and `payByTime <= submitResultTime <= unlockTime <= externalDisputeUnlockTime`.

**M8 deadline** — the tx **must** carry a TTL (no TTL → `..._masumi_deadline`),
converted to POSIX ms via the network clock, and must satisfy
`ttlPosixMs <= payByTime`. A lock that could land after its own pay-by deadline
is not a valid lock, so the TTL is mandatory here even though it's optional in
Stage C.

**M9 collateral** — `collateral >= 0`; if non-zero it must be at least
`1_435_230` lovelace; and it must not exceed the output's coin.

**Asset set** — for lovelace, `output.coin >= amount + collateral` and no native
assets; for a token, the held amount must equal `amount` exactly and be the only
asset. `!=`, not `>=`: escrow locks an exact figure.

**M7 field matching** — three different behaviours, worth separating:

*Always checked:* buyer credentials against the payer address, and
`sellerAddress` (which must be present — an absent one is a mismatch).

*Checked only when declared* — omit and nothing is asserted: `referenceKey`,
`referenceSignature`, `sellerNonce`, `identifierFromPurchaser`, `agentIdentifier`,
`inputHash`, `payByTime`, `submitResultTime`, `unlockTime`,
`externalDisputeUnlockTime`, `collateralReturnLovelace`.

*Checked even when undeclared:* `buyerReturnAddress` and `sellerReturnAddress`.
These are **not** optional in the same sense. `returnAddressMatches` treats an
omitted declaration as asserting the datum carries **no** return address:

```java
if (declared == null) return actual == null;   // omitted ⇒ datum must be None
```

So omitting `buyerReturnAddress` while the datum sets one fails with
`..._masumi_datum_mismatch`. Omission is an assertion of absence, not a skip.

For the genuinely optional fields, the declare-to-check design is inherited from
the TS reference, where they are typed `string | undefined` — an undeclared field
is not an assertion, so there is nothing to disagree with. Callers that want one
enforced must declare it.

## `script` — arbitrary Plutus lock

| # | Check | Code |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | `extra.scriptHash` or `extra.script` present, and the reconstructed script address ≡ `payTo` | `..._script_address_mismatch` |
| S2 | Asset/amount/min-UTxO | *(shared Stage E)* |
| S3 | Datum present per the Plutus version's policy | `..._script_datum_missing` *(additive)* |

**S1** reconstructs the address rather than trusting `payTo`. When `parameters`
are supplied, the script is applied via aiken's UPLC `apply_params` and hashed —
byte-for-byte conformance-pinned against the reference for both empty and
parametrized vectors (see `ScriptAddressConformanceTest`). Parameter types:
`bytes`, `string`, `bigint`, `integer`, `boolean`.

**S3** varies by `extra.script.type`:

| Version | Requires |
|---|---|
| `plutusV1` | a datum **hash** (inline is not valid for V1) |
| `plutusV2` | inline **or** hash |
| `plutusV3` | inline or hash, unless `x402.verification.script-datum-policy: v3-optional` |
| absent / unknown (hash-only) | inline or hash |

V3 is configurable because the datum genuinely is optional for some V3 validators,
but requiring it is the safe default — a lock whose validator needs a datum and
didn't get one is unspendable, i.e. funds burned. Default is `strict`; opt out
per-deployment only if you know your validator tolerates it.

## Parity with the TypeScript reference

Codes are wire-identical to `x402/typescript/packages/mechanisms/cardano/src/constants.ts`,
with two additive codes (`..._payer_not_witness`, `..._script_datum_missing`)
covering gaps the reference leaves open. Both are flagged for upstreaming
(spec §16.3).

One deliberate, documented divergence: for input outside the reference's own
declared type contract — an explicit JSON `null` on a field typed
`string | undefined` — the two implementations reject differently. Java matches
TS for every in-contract input. Chasing that last nuance would trade a
skip-vs-reject difference for a mismatch-vs-invalid-payload error-code
difference, at hot-path risk, for no behavioural gain.

Coverage lives in `ExactCardanoVerifyTest` (32), `MasumiTransferVerifierTest`
(24), `ScriptTransferVerifierTest` (12), `ScriptAddressConformanceTest` (9), and
`CardanoTransactionDecoderTest` (6).
